## Week 1 Weekly Challenge Code Refactoring

This project involved refactoring the html code for a SEO company website to improve both the accessibility and logical structure of the code, while maintaining the existing functionality of the site

### Accessibility

Alt text descriptions were added to the pertininent images to ensure screen readers can capture the important information presented in each image.

### HTML Structure and Semantics

The previous code had been divided almost exclusively using "div" elements providing little to no semantic or intuitive structure. Every section was renamed from div to an appropriate element to provide an easier to follow and understand code structure. A new website title was added as well.
